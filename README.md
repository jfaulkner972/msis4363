# MSIS4363 Mobile Application Development
MSIS 4363 Final Project- Course Planning Android Application

This is my final project for Oklahoma State University's MSIS 4363 Mobile Application Development course. The goal of this application was to create an application that would allow users to check if they could enroll in an MSIS course, or if they lacked a prerequisite for that course. The final version of this application has three main features. 

1. Upload Course Progress

    1.1 Users can enter their progress on this page. This allows the user to reference if they have passed a course, failed a course, or are currently taking a course. Upon navigating to this page, the user is unable to make any changes until the update button is clicked. This is to prevent accidental changes. Upon clicking the update button and making the relevant changes, the data is uploaded into the database.
    
2. Check a Course

    2.1 Users can see the prerequisites for a specific course. Upon clicking the course, a query is sent to the database which returns all the associated prerequisites for that course   
    
3. Plan a schedule

    3.1 Users can select multiple courses to simulate planning their next semester. Once the user has selected up to six courses, the textview is updated to reflect the neccessary prerequisites. Users can then save up to four schedules. This allow for easy reference to their proposed schedules and allows Users to navigate between their schedule and course progress quickly.
